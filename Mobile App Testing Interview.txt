1.About yourself(Introduction)(3)
2.Mobile App Testing Basics(3)
  Definition:
  Mobile app testing is a process 
  in which application software 
  developed for mobile devices is
  tested for its functionality,
  usability and consistency.
  Type of testing done:
  Functional Testing is done on
  mobile phones.
3.Types of mobile apps(3)
  (Native,Hybrid,Web)
4.Package name/extension of android and
  ios applications(3)
  Android - .apk
  IOS     - .ipa
5.Current version of Android OS(3)
  13
6.Current version of IOS(3)
  16.3.1
7.Types of testing/Levels of testing
  (Smoke,Regression,Black-box etc.)
8.Types of models in testing
  (Waterfall,Agile,V-Model etc.)
9.High severity and low priority(3)
  Example:
  If an application or web page crashes 
  when a remote link is clicked,then the
  priority is low and severity is high.
10.High priority and low severity(3)
   Example:
   If the company name is misspelled in 
   the home page of the website,then the 
   priority is high and severity is low 
   to fix it.

12.About project work 
13.Types of testing in detail:
   Unit Testing-
   A programmatic test that tests the 
   internal working of a unit of code,
   such as a method or a function.

   Regression Testing-
   Ensures that existing features or
   functionality that used to work are
   not broken due to new code changes.

   Integration Testing-
   Ensures that multiple components of 
   systems work as expected when they 
   are combined to produce a result.

   Smoke Testing-
   A quick test performed to ensure that
   the software works at the most basic
   level and doesn't crash when it's 
   started.
14.What is exploratory testing?(3)
   In exploratory testing,the tester
   interacts with the software in 
   whatever way he wants and follow 
   the instructions to navigate various
   paths and functionality.
15.What is an API?(3)
   It is a means of communication between 
   two software components.
16.What is a bug in software testing?(3)
   A software bug is an error in the 
   software that produces wrong results.
17.What is a test plan?(3)
   A test plan is a dynamic document 
   monitored and controlled by the 
   testing manager.
18.What is defect life cycle?(3)
   Defect life cycle is a life cycle of
   various stages through which a defect
   goes through its whole lifetime.
   This life cycle starts as soon as the
   defect is reported by the tester and
   ends when the tester ensures that 
   the defect is resolved.
19.What is a test case?(3)
   A test case is a set of conditions
   which determines whether a system 
   under test satisfies requirements or
   works correctly.
20.What are the phases involved in 
   STLC?(3)
   Requirement - Here,the tester 
   Analysis      understands requirements
                 and identifies the
                 testable requirements.

   Test        - Here the test strategy 
   Planning      is defined.

   Test Case   - Here the test cases are
   Development   defined and developed.
   
   Environment - It is a setup of s/w
   Setup         and h/w for the testing
                 teams to execute test
                 cases.
   
   Test        - It is the process of
   Excecution    executing the code and
                 comparing the expected
                 and actual results.
  
   Test Cycle  - It involves evaluating
   Closure       cycle completion criteria
                 based on test coverage,
                 quality,cost etc.
21.What are the different methods of
   testing?(2)
   Black-box testing:
   It is a testing strategy based on
   requirements and specifications.
   
   White-box testing:
   It is a testing strategy based on 
   internal paths,code structures and
   implementation of the software being
   tested.
   
   Grey-box testing:
   It is a strategy in which the tester
   has limited knowledge of the internal
   details of the program.
22.What is Selenium?Why is it a prefered
   tool for Automation Testing?(2)
   Selenium is an open source tool 
   which is used for automating the 
   tests carried out on web browsers.

   Since Selenium is open-source,there
   is no licensing cost involved,which
   is a major advantage over other
   testing tools.
23.What are the different types of 
   locators in Selenium?(2)
   -ID
   -ClassName
   -Name
   -TagName
   -linkText
   -PartiallinkText
   -Xpath
   -CSS Selector
   -DOM
